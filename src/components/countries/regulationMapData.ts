    summary: 'The United States enacted the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act) on July 18, 2025, establishing the first comprehensive federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. The legislation passed with strong bipartisan support (68-30 in the Senate, 308-122 in the House).\n\nThe GENIUS Act clarifies that payment stablecoins are neither securities nor commodities, removing SEC and CFTC oversight. Instead, bank issuers are regulated by their primary federal banking regulator, while nonbank issuers are overseen by the OCC. Issuers must maintain 100% reserve backing with highly liquid assets, publish monthly reserve compositions, and honor redemptions at par within one day. Federal agencies missed the July 18, 2026 statutory deadline to finalize implementing regulations. Treasury issued the first binding rule, an interim final rule on certifying state regimes, on September 30, 2026, and the OCC is targeting its final implementing rule for November 2026. Full compliance is required by January 18, 2027 (or 120 days after final regulations issue). Existing issuers have until July 18, 2028 to comply.',

MAS requires stablecoins to be issued solely from Singapore (no multi-jurisdictional issuance initially). In November 2025, MAS announced Project BLOOM (Borderless, Liquid, Open, Online, Multi-currency) to extend settlement capabilities using tokenized assets and well-regulated stablecoins, with Q2 2026 cross-border QR payment trials between Thailand and Singapore.
